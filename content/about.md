# About Me #

![](/img/Dave_Klemish_Photo.png# floatleft bordered "Me circa 2012") My 
name is Dave Klemish. I'm currently looking for opportunities to 
apply my knowledge of analytics to real world problems and helping others 
extract practical and useful information from their data. I also enjoy 
teaching, which is one of the reasons why I'm writing this blog.

As an undergrad, I studied a mixture of math, computer science and physics. 
From there, I fell into an insurance career as an actuary as math students 
are wont to do.  While I enjoyed that enough to do it for a number of years, 
I eventually decided to go back to school for graduate work.  As part 
of that process I tried to do a doctorate in statistics, but eventually 
decided that wasn't for me and hence joined the ranks of the ABD (all but 
dissertation). These experiences have made me comfortable both with 
technical topics and communicating with non-technical audiences.

I currently live in Raleigh, NC with my wife. When I'm not thinking about math, 
I enjoy reading, exercise and playing the guitar fow which I fully intend on 
eventually having my own Youtube music channel.
